# hubot-script-directory

A directory of available hubot scripts from NPM.

## Shelved!

I've had to shelve this for the moment, as searching NPM requires a download of the entire package list and then filtering it client side (NPM doesn't allow you to filter it when you make the request). This uses way too much memory than Heroku will give me.

So, until I can find a way around this I'm putting development on hold.
